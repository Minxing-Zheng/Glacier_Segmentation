# Glacier_Segmentation [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08184.pdf)

This is the repo for the glaicer segmentation project which is advised by [Prof. Kris Sankaran](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/sankaran-kris/) at UW Madison.

In this project, we tried to provide a comprehensive error analysis using interactive data visualization for glacier segmentation problem. We built an [shiny app](https://bruce-zheng.shinyapps.io/glacier_segmententation/) to provide an interactive panel for error analysis. It consists of an interactive glacier map and accuracy curve for testing patches where users can click the map or accuracy curve to dynamically link to the corresponding raw satellite image, its label and prediction result. ![annotation_app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91963401/147982481-5906df11-83eb-4c64-aa3a-02c2b398a1bd.jpg)
